### Reflection

For this assignment, my main focus was to make sure all required features worked correctly when the application was run locally by opening index.html. 
I tried to keep the implementation simple, stable, and easy to test instead of adding unnecessary complexity.
One of the main challenges was working with the Google Maps JavaScript API. 
Understanding how API keys, browser security, and local file execution interact took more time than I expected. 
Through testing, I learned that API key restrictions and local execution methods can directly affect whether the map loads properly, which helped me better understand how third-party APIs behave in real development environments.
Layout and styling were also more difficult than I initially thought. 
I originally wanted to build a more complex three-level layout, but the spacing and proportions did not work well, and small CSS changes often caused unexpected layout issues. 
Because of this, I chose to simplify the layout and focus on clarity and usability, which made the interface more stable and predictable.
While testing the map interactions, I realized that deleting and managing markers could be improved. 
The assignment required only deleting landmarks, but during testing I felt that having direct control over map markers would make the application easier to use. 
Based on this, I added a separate marker removal feature, so markers could be managed more flexibly during a session without reloading the page.
Due to time constraints from other coursework, co-op work, and job applications, I focused on completing all required functionality and ensuring the application behaved correctly. 
If I had more time, I would further refine the layout and improve data persistence. 
Overall, this project helped me better understand front-end state management, UI debugging, and practical issues that arise when working with third-party APIs.
