# TTourVValk

TTourVValk is a front-end walking tour web application that lets users create their own walking routes by adding meaningful landmarks to a map.

Instead of rushing from place to place, this app focuses on slow exploration — noticing small details, personal memories, and places that matter to you.

## Why “TTourVValk”?

The name comes from the Korean word **뚜벅뚜벅 (ttu-beok ttu-beok)**, which describes the sound and feeling of walking steadily on foot.

In Korean, *뚜벅뚜벅* is often used to represent walking slowly without a vehicle, step by step, taking your time.  
It reflects the idea of moving at your own pace, paying attention to your surroundings, and building your own path rather than following the fastest route.

TTourVValk combines that feeling with the idea of a walking tour — a personal journey shaped by where you choose to stop.
